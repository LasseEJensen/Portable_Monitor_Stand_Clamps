# Portable_Monitor_Stand_Clamps

A set of custom 3D-printable clamps designed to improve the stability and usability of a transport bag as a portable stand for various monitors, including but not limited to the ASUS® ZenScreen™.

## Overview

These clamps are designed to slide into the sides of a folded transport bag, creating a deep groove that securely holds a portable monitor in place. This project aims to provide a stable and practical solution for users who find the standard transport bag setup too flimsy for regular use.

## Features

- **Increased Stability**: Provides a deeper groove to hold the monitor securely.
- **Easy to Use**: Simply slide the clamps into the sides of the folded bag.
- **Open Source**: Designed to be freely used, modified, and distributed.

## Getting Started

2. **3D Print the Clamps**: Use a 3D printer to print the clamps with your preferred material. PLA or ABS is recommended for durability.
3. **Install the Clamps**: Slide the clamps into the sides of your folded transport bag.
